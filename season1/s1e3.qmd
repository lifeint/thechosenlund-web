^15^ Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. ^16^ But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ^17^ Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."

:::{.callout-tip}
**_The Shema_** (or [Shema Yisrael](#sec-reading)) is the central declaration of Jewish faith. It affirms the oneness of God and is recited daily in morning and evening prayers. Drawn from key Torah passages (Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 11:13–21; Numbers 15:37–41), **the Shema** calls for wholehearted love and devotion to God. It functions as Judaism’s *core confession of faith* and is traditionally among the final words spoken at death. During its recitation, worshipers often cover their eyes for the opening line to eliminate distractions and focus fully on God’s unity.

## :handshake: Discussion {#sec-discussion}

1.  As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2.  In this episode, Jesus spends a lot of time with the children, entertaining them and teaching various things. What does this dedication to the children say about about Jesus' character?
3.  Jesus said that adults, although they have lived longer and know more, need the faith of children. Why do you think He said this? What does the faith of a child look like?
4. In the conversation about justice, Jesus calls the children to be different from those around them; He calls them to be peacemakers. How can we deal with vengeful feelings?
5.  We saw Jesus praying often in this episode, sometimes with a lot of passion and emotion. What do you make of this depiction of Jesus praying?
6. Jesus' emotional prayers are contrasting with His playfulness in the presence of the children. How do you think His effort to be relatable and approachable affected the perception the children had of Him and His teachings?
7. This episode highlights Jesus’ ordinary, human activities — making a fire, cooking, working, eating, sleeping, even dealing with accidents. What are the filmmakers trying to communicate about how Jesus understood and used His divine power?

## :thought_balloon: Food for thought {#sec-thought}

1. Christians believe Jesus is God — the second person of the Trinity. How might this shape the way He relates to creation (for example, saying *“It is good”* over His finished work) and to people (through timing and foreknowledge)? What do you imagine it would be like for Jesus, as God, to hear children recite the Shema?
2. *"Everyone has a much larger job than just their trade."* What might your “larger job” be at home, at school, or in your workplace?
3. In this episode, how does Jesus describe the purpose of His being there? How does that purpose shape the way He lives and works?
