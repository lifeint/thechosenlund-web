## :book: Scripture {#sec-scripture}

:::{.callout-note}
### [Numbers 21:4-9]()
^4^ From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. ^5^ And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.” ^6^ Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. ^7^ And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. ^8^ And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” ^9^ So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.

## :handshake: Discussion {#sec-discussion}

1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. Reflect on Nicodemus’ journey to Jesus. How did he move from being a devout Pharisee to sitting before Jesus? What character qualities do you see in him along the way?
3. How does Jesus describe the way the Spirit works in a person’s life? How do you recognize the Spirit’s influence—both in your own life and in the lives of others?
4. Although Matthew is one of the wealthiest men in town, he is deeply isolated: *“When you realize that nobody else in the world cares what happens to you, you think only about yourself.”* What do you see happening inside Matthew over the last few episodes? How do you understand his visit to his parents’ house in light of the changes he is undergoing?
5. How did you react to Simon’s response when Jesus calls Matthew? What do you think Jesus is trying to teach Simon and the other disciples through this moment?
6. Matthew says yes to Jesus almost immediately, while Nicodemus hesitates. What do you think enables Matthew to respond so quickly? What might be holding Nicodemus back? Which of the two do you find yourself identifying with more, and why?
7. What ideas, images, or emotions come to mind when you hear the phrase “born again”? In this episode, what do you think Jesus means when He says that one cannot see the kingdom of God unless they are born again?

## :thought_balloon: Food for thought {#sec-thought}
1. Stories like the bronze serpent can feel unsettling to modern readers. What led the Israelites to suffer in the first place? Why do you think God chose healing through the lifted serpent rather than simply removing the danger? How does this help you think about why God would later “give His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” ([John 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.3.16)). 
2. What do you find yourself drawn toward without fully understanding why? What might those quiet attractions or impulses reveal about your deeper longings?
3. If Jesus already knew there would be a dinner at Matthew’s house, did Matthew truly have a choice? How do you hold together God’s foreknowledge and human freedom in your own understanding?
