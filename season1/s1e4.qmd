## :handshake: Discussion

1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. In this episode, Simon hits a moral *rock bottom* (a moral *sandbar*?) when he considers turning in his fellow fishermen -- men he drinks and hangs out with -- to the Romans. What do you think ultimately stops him from going through with it? Was it calculation and self-interest, or something deeper?
3. Simon’s wife, Eden, emerges as one of the most significant figures in this episode. How did you experience her faith and her firm, yet loving, stance toward Simon? If you were in her position, how do you imagine you would respond?
4. Matthew continues to change as he tries to make sense of both the predictable and the miraculous. How do you think he views Simon at this point? How does Matthew describe -- or struggle to describe -- the miracle he witnesses?

:::{.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Spoiler alert!
Matthew is traditionally understood to be the author of the first Gospel in the New Testament. Did you notice who provides him with his writing tools -- and, effectively, commissions him to carefully record all that he witnesses?
:::

5. After Matthew warns Simon that he will be arrested in the morning, Simon chooses to go fishing anyway. What do you think drives that decision? Faith, desperation, a last act of defiance -- or a quiet hope for something more?
6. Earlier, Zebedee tells Simon at the bar that he is on his own in the mess he created. Yet on Simon’s darkest night, Andrew, Zebedee, and his sons all show up to help him. What do you think moved them to act? What does this reveal about their relationship with Simon -- and about who they are?
7. What did you learn in this episode about how Jews like Andrew, Simon, and Zebedee expected the Messiah to appear and act? In light of what you reflected on earlier -- especially about Messianic expectations shared by the children -- do you think it was easy for people to accept that Jesus might be the Messiah they were waiting for? Why or why not?

## :thought_balloon: Food for thought

1. In Simon’s recitation, he seems to suggest that God has repeatedly let His people down. He lists painful events and places much of the blame on God -- but his retelling leaves important things out. What is missing from Simon’s version of the story? In what ways are you tempted to a similar kind of selective remembering -- blaming God while overlooking your own role or responsibility?  
2. Which area of your life do you find hardest to release control over -- relationships, work, or future plans? What do you think makes that area especially difficult to trust God with?
3. Simon first tells Jesus, “Depart from me,” and then immediately agrees to follow Him wherever He goes. What do you think is happening inside Simon in that moment? Have you ever felt a similar tension between reverence and trust?
