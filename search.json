Unlike the priestly Sadducees, they believed the Law required thoughtful interpretation so it could be faithfully applied to changing circumstances. Their interpretive approach shaped the Mishnah and became foundational for later Rabbinic Judaism, allowing Judaism to survive and adapt after the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD.",

To avoid “taking the Lord’s name in vain,” Jews developed the practice of saying Adonai rather than pronouncing the sacred name. In many Bible translations, you’ll notice that LORD appears in all capital letters in the Old Testament. This signals that the original Hebrew word is Yahweh.",

Fueled by intense devotion to Jewish identity and, at times, messianic expectations, Zealots embraced violent resistance against the Romans and against fellow Jews seen as collaborators. Their actions played a significant role in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70 CE), which ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the tragic siege of Masada. See more in Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCohortes urbanae (Urban Cohorts) were elite Roman military units established by Augustus to serve as a police force and security detail for the city of Rome and later other key cities, maintaining public order, controlling crowds, and handling crime, distinct from but serving alongside the Praetorian Guard, led by the Urban Prefect, and recruited from Italian citizens. They provided emperors with vital urban control and could be deployed for military campaigns, acting as a crucial internal security force. See more in Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFeast of Tabernacles, also known as Sukkot or the Feast of Booths, is a Torah-commanded Jewish festival that celebrates the autumn harvest and commemorates Israel’s journey out of Egypt. It is observed for seven days beginning on the 15th of Tishrei. Sukkot is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, during which Israelites were commanded to travel to Jerusalem to worship at the Temple. See more in Wikipedia",

OF THE KING.\n\n    1 O Lord, Thou art our King for ever and ever,\n      For in Thee, O God, doth our soul glory.\n    2 How long are the days of man’s life upon the earth?\n      As are his days, so is the hope (set) upon him.\n    3 But we hope in God, our deliverer;\n    For the might of our God is for ever with mercy,\n      4 And the kingdom of our God is for ever over the nations in judgement.\n\n    5(4) Thou, O Lord, didst choose David (to be) king over Israel,\n      And swaredst to him touching his seed that never should his kingdom fail before Thee.\n    6(5) But, for our sins, sinners rose up against us;\n      They assailed us and thrust us out;\n      What Thou hadst not promised to them, they took away (from us) with violence.\n    7 They in no wise glorified Thy honourable name;\n      (6) They set a (worldly) monarchy in place of (that which was) their excellency;\n      8 They laid waste the throne of David in tumultuous arrogance.\n\n    (7) But Thou, O God, didst cast them down, and remove their seed from the earth,\n      9 In that there rose up against them a man that was alien to our race.\n    10(8) According to their sins didst Thou recompense them, O God;\n      So that it befell them according to their deeds.\n    11(9) God showed them no pity;\n      He sought out their seed and let not one of them go free.\n    12(10) Faithful is the Lord in all His judgements\n      Which He doeth upon the earth.\n\n    13(11) The lawless one laid waste our land so that none inhabited it,\n      They destroyed young and old and their children together.\n    14(12) In the heat of His anger He sent them away even unto the west,\n      And (He exposed) the rulers of the land unsparingly to derision.\n    15(13) Being an alien the enemy acted proudly,\n      And his heart was alien from our God.\n    16(14) And all … Jerusalem,\n      As also the nations …\n    17(15) And the children of the covenant in the midst of the mingled peoples …\n      There was not among them one that wrought in the midst of Jerusalem mercy and truth.\n    18(16) They that loved the synagogues of the pious fled from them,\n      As sparrows that fly from their nest.\n    19(17) They wandered in deserts that their lives might be saved from harm,\n      And precious in the eyes of them that lived abroad was any that escaped alive from them.\n      20(18) Over the whole earth were they scattered by lawless (men).\n    21(19) For the heavens withheld the rain from dropping upon the earth,\n      Springs were stopped (that sprang) perennial(ly) out of the deeps, (that ran down) from lofty mountains.\n    For there was none among them that wrought righteousness and justice;\n      (20) From the chief of them to the least (of them) all were sinful;\n      22 The king was a transgressor, and the judge disobedient, and the people sinful.\n\n    23(21) Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David,\n      At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant.\n    24(22) And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers,\n      25 And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample (her) down to destruction.\n    (23) Wisely, righteously 26 he shall thrust out sinners from (the) inheritance,\n      He shall destroy the pride of the sinner as a potter’s vessel.\n    (24) With a rod of iron he shall break in pieces all their substance,\n      27 He shall destroy the godless nations with the word of his mouth;\n    (25) At his rebuke nations shall flee before him,\n      And he shall reprove sinners for the thoughts of their heart.\n\n    28(26) And he shall gather together a holy people, whom he shall lead in righteousness,\n      And he shall judge the tribes of the people that has been sanctified by the Lord his God.\n    29(27) And he shall not suffer unrighteousness to lodge any more in their midst,\n      Nor shall there dwell with them any man that knoweth wickedness,\n      30 For he shall know them, that they are all sons of their God.\n    (28) And he shall divide them according to their tribes upon the land,\n      31 And neither sojourner nor alien shall sojourn with them any more.\n    (29) He shall judge peoples and nations in the wisdom of his righteousness. Selah.\n\n    32(30) And he shall have the heathen nations to serve him under his yoke;\n      And he shall glorify the Lord in a place to be seen of (?) all the earth;\n      33 And he shall purge Jerusalem, making it holy as of old:\n    34(31) So that nations shall come from the ends of the earth to see his glory,\n      Bringing as gifts her sons who had fainted,\n      35 And to see the glory of the Lord, wherewith God hath glorified her.\n    (32) And he (shall be) a righteous king, taught of God, over them,\n    36 And there shall be no unrighteousness in his days in their midst,\n      For all shall be holy and their king the anointed of the Lord.\n    37(33) For he shall not put his trust in horse and rider and bow,\n      Nor shall he multiply for himself gold and silver for war,\n      Nor shall he gather confidence from (?) a multitude (?) for the day of battle.\n    38(34) The Lord Himself is his king, the hope of him that is mighty through (his) hope in God.\n\n    〈 〉 All nations (shall be) in fear before him,\n      39(35) For he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth for ever.\n    40 He will bless the people of the Lord with wisdom and gladness,\n      41(36) And he himself (will be) pure from sin, so that he may rule a great people.\n    He will rebuke rulers, and remove sinners by the might of his word;\n      42(37) And (relying) upon his God, throughout his days he will not stumble;\n    For God will make him mighty by means of (His) holy spirit,\n      And wise by means of the spirit of understanding, with strength and righteousness.\n    43(38) And the blessing of the Lord (will be) with him: he will be strong and stumble not;\n      44(39) His hope (will be) in the Lord: who then can prevail against him?\n    (40) (He will be) mighty in his works, and strong in the fear of God,\n      45 (He will be) shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously,\n         And will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture.\n      46(41) He will lead them all aright,\n         And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed.\n    47(42) This (will be) the majesty of the king of Israel whom God knoweth;\n      He will raise him up over the house of Israel to correct him.\n    48(43) His words (shall be) more refined than costly gold, the choicest;\n      In the assemblies he will judge the peoples, the tribes of the sanctified.\n    49 His words (shall be) like the words of the holy ones in the midst of sanctified peoples.\n    50 Blessed be they that shall be in those days,\n      In that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass\n        in the gathering together of the tribes.\n    51 May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel!\n      May He deliver us from the uncleanness of unholy enemies!\n\n    The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePsalm of Solomon 18 (Charles, 1913)\n\n\n\nA PSALM. OF SOLOMON. AGAIN OF THE ANOINTED OF THE LORD.\n\n    1 Lord, Thy mercy is over the works of Thy hands for ever;\n      Thy goodness is over Israel with a rich gift.\n    2 Thine eyes look upon them, so that none of them suffers want;\n      3 Thine ears listen to the hopeful prayer of the poor.\n    (3) Thy judgements (are executed) upon the whole earth in mercy;\n      4 And Thy love (is) toward the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel.\n    (4) Thy chastisement is upon us as (upon) a first-born, only-begotten son,\n      5 To turn back the obedient soul from folly (that is wrought) in ignorance.\n    6(5) May God cleanse Israel against the day of mercy and blessing,\n      Against the day of choice when He bringeth back His anointed.\n\n    7(6) Blessed shall they be that shall be in those days,\n      In that they shall see the goodness of the Lord which He shall perform for the generation that is to come,\n    8(7) Under the rod of chastening of the Lord’s anointed in the fear of his God,\n      In the spirit of wisdom and righteousness and strength;\n    9(8) That he may direct (every) man in the works of righteousness by the fear of God,\n      That he may establish them all before the Lord,\n      10(9) A good generation (living) in the fear of God in the days of mercy. Selah.\n\n    11(10) Great is our God and glorious, dwelling in the highest.\n    12 (It is He) who hath established in (their) courses the lights (of heaven) for determining seasons from year to year,\n      And they have not turned aside from the way which He appointed them.\n    13(11) In the fear of God (they pursue) their path every day,\n      From the day God created them and for evermore.\n    14(12) And they have erred not since the day He created them.\n      Since the generations of old they have not withdrawn from their path,\n      Unless God commanded them (so to do) by the command of His servants.",

Samaritans worshiped at their own temple on Mount Gerizim, which was destroyed by the Jewish ruler John Hyrcanus around 111–110 BCE, greatly intensifying tensions. Ancient sources such as Josephus also describe Samaritans at times aligning themselves with Seleucid rulers during the Maccabean period, further alienating them from Judean Jews. Josephus later reports an incident in which Samaritans desecrated the Jerusalem Temple by scattering human bones, likely in the early first century CE, helping explain the deep mistrust that existed in Jesus’ day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSamaritans believe in a messianic figure called the Taheb (meaning “the Restorer” or “the one who returns”). They believe that when the Taheb comes, he will clarify the true meaning of the Law of Moses (the Torah) and restore the authentic worship of God on Mount Gerizim. The Taheb expected to come from the tribe of Joseph holds a central place in Samaritan belief, alongside their faith in one God and their conviction that Moses is the ultimate prophet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPhotina is the traditional name later given to the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4. The name does not appear in the biblical text and comes from early Christian writings, particularly in Eastern Christian tradition. Its historical accuracy cannot be confirmed.",

Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 22 When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, “Why do you question in your hearts? 23 Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? 24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the man who was paralyzed—“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.” 25 And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. 26 And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”\n\n\nDownload Bible App Here",

What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?\nThe miracle at Cana clearly sets off a chain reaction– leper hears about Jesus from his sister, his cleansing is witnessed by Tamar, she then leads the paralyzed man to Jesus. How do you see Jesus responding to this growing momentum? Why do you think He tells the healed leper to remain silent, yet allows the paralyzed man to return home publicly, walking through the city?\nSimon and Andrew appear unusually protective of Jesus when Matthew shows up at their door. What do you think is really happening beneath the surface–for Matthew, and for Simon and Andrew themselves?\nHow did you interpret what unfolded during the private reading and discussion in the synagogue? Do you think Nicodemus’ earlier conversation with John the Baptizer influenced how he heard or responded to Shmuel in this moment? What parallels or echoes did you notice between those encounters?\nJesus refers back to his earlier teaching about the future judgment, when angels will separate the righteous from the wicked, but not in the way many might expect. How does He frame the future, and what kind of mindset does He seem to be forming in His listeners? How does this challenge common expectations about the end times?\nJesus challenges common assumptions about spiritual practices like prayer and charity. After reading Luke 18:10–14, what do you think Jesus is saying about how people approach God–and about what truly matters in spiritual life?\nBoth Matthew and Nicodemus are drawn to Zebedee’s house out of curiosity, but for very different reasons. What do you think is stirring in each of them at this point? How are their paths toward Jesus similar, and how are they different?",

Who can forgive sins but God alone?” After reading John 2:24-25, how do you hold this together with our modern sense of privacy and inner life? How does this compare with what Jesus teaches about privacy in prayer and giving?.\nWhen the paralyzed man asks Mary Magdalene, “What if you were me?” she answers, “I was you, once.” What does this exchange reveal about compassion born from experience? How does it shape the way you think about empathy, compassion and caring for others?\nWhat do you sense is really driving Shmuel? He seems unable (or unwilling) to listen to anyone but himself trying to put God back into the box Shmuel carved for Him. Have you encountered people like that in your own life?",

What do you think ultimately stops him from going through with it? Was it calculation and self-interest, or something deeper?\nSimon’s wife, Eden, emerges as one of the most significant figures in this episode. How did you experience her faith and her firm, yet loving, stance toward Simon? If you were in her position, how do you imagine you would respond?\nMatthew continues to change as he tries to make sense of both the predictable and the miraculous. How do you think he views Simon at this point? How does Matthew describe – or struggle to describe – the miracle he witnesses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSpoiler alert!\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew is traditionally understood to be the author of the first Gospel in the New Testament. Did you notice who provides him with his writing tools – and, effectively, commissions him to carefully record all that he witnesses?\n\n\n\n\nAfter Matthew warns Simon that he will be arrested in the morning, Simon chooses to go fishing anyway. What do you think drives that decision? Faith, desperation, a last act of defiance – or a quiet hope for something more?\nEarlier, Zebedee tells Simon at the bar that he is on his own in the mess he created. Yet on Simon’s darkest night, Andrew, Zebedee, and his sons all show up to help him. What do you think moved them to act? What does this reveal about their relationship with Simon – and about who they are?\nWhat did you learn in this episode about how Jews like Andrew, Simon, and Zebedee expected the Messiah to appear and act? In light of what you reflected on earlier – especially about Messianic expectations shared by the children – do you think it was easy for people to accept that Jesus might be the Messiah they were waiting for? Why or why not?",
