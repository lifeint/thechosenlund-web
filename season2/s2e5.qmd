## :handshake: Discussion {#sec-discussion}
1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. Mary's fear. Chasing past
3. What is Atticus up to? What do you think he expects to find and what he discovers? What surprises him?
4. How was the actual real Messiah different than what Simon the Zealot expected?
4. John the Baptizer getting impatient
5. Jesus reads the mind of the demoniac
6. What strikes you most about the conversations between Jesus and his cousin, John the Baptist (John was six months older). Read Luke 3:1-20 Jesus wasn’t living up to John’s expectations.  What did John want Jesus to do?


## :thought_balloon: Food for thought {#sec-thought}
1. What might be moving John the Baptizer? Why did he decide to go and confront Herod, despite what Jesus tells him.
2. Jesus says he healed Jesse to get Simon's attention. What unexplainable event happened in your life, which might have been God trying to get your attention?
3. How does the memorized psalm make appearance in this episode of The Chosen?  How does Mary react to them?  Why do you think Jesus quotes them to Matthew?  How are they important for us?
4. Do you believe it is a Christian’s responsibility to “call out” all of the sin we see in other people’s lives? Why or why not?

:::{.callout-note}
Two Jewish prayers appearing in this episode:

- Birkat Ha'Ilanot (For blossoming trees): "Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the Universe, who has withheld nothing from His world, and has created in it beautiful creatures and trees for human beings to enjoy."
- Elokai Neshama (Morning Blessing): My God, the soul that You have placed within me is pure. You created it; You formed it; You have breathed it into me, and You preserve it within me. Ultimately, You will take it from me, and restore it within me in the Time to Come. As long as the soul is within me, I thankfully acknowledge You, God, my Lord, and Lord of my fathers, Master of all works, Lord of all souls. Blessed are You, God, Who restores souls to the dead.
