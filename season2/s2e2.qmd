### [John 1:43-51](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.43-51)
^43^ The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” ^44^ Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. ^45^ Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” ^46^ Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” ^47^ Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” ^48^ Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” ^49^ Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” ^50^ Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” ^51^ And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

| ^7^ Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;

|   “Your face, Lord, do I seek.”[b]
| ^9^ Hide not your face from me.
| Turn not your servant away in anger,

|   O God of my salvation!

> If I didn't know any better...I'd say you each have a death wish.

:::{.callout-tip}
**Caesarea Philippi** was a city built and named by Philip the Tetrarch, a son of Herod the Great and Cleopatra, making him a half-brother to Herod Antipas (ruler of Galilee) and Herod Archelaus. Ruling from 4 BCE to 34 CE, he governed northeast Palestine (Ituraea, Trachonitis, etc.), developed Caesarea Philippi as his capital (renaming Panias).

## :handshake: Discussion {#sec-discussion}
1. As you watched this episode, which characters or moments stood out to you the most, and why? What was it about those scenes or people that captured your attention?
2. The episode begins and ends with Nathanael. He believed his life was devoted to serving God—or did he? Now he feels his life is over, telling the bartender that he “died of hubris.” What do you think Nathanael means by that, and why is it significant to his story?
3. Matthew and Thaddeus talk about routines that “began as a chore” but eventually “became a habit.” How do habits take root in your life? What helps transform something difficult or tedious into something life-giving?
4. Nathanael believed heaven was silent, yet Jesus tells him, “I saw you.” What does this suggest about how God hears and responds to our prayers?
5. Jesus tells Nathanael that He saw him under the fig tree. Who was Nathanael praying to in that moment? What does Jesus’ awareness of Nathanael’s lowest point reveal about who Jesus is?
6. The disciples regularly memorize and recite Scripture. Seeing this, the women and Matthew express a desire to study the Scriptures as well. Why is the study of Scripture important? Read and discuss [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2TI.3.16-17) and [John 5:39-40](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.5.39-40). How do these passages shape our understanding of Scripture’s purpose?
7. Simon asks Jesus for “more structure,” but Jesus responds that there’s no need for it yet because “I am still here.” What do you think is motivating Simon’s request? What might Jesus be teaching His disciples by delaying the structure they seem to want?


## :thought_balloon: Food for thought {#sec-thought}
1. When everything seems to fall apart and God feels silent, can you identify with Nathanael’s cry? What do Nathanael (and [David](#sec-reading)) teach you about how to pray when answers don’t come as expected?
2. Can you identify with Matthew’s struggle to fit in? When have you felt like an outsider, and who helped you feel more at ease? What did they do? How might you extend that same welcome to someone who feels like Matthew does now?
